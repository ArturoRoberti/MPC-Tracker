# MPC-Tracker
Python toolbox to ease the use of MPC for tracking a goal with the presence obstacles. Goal and obstacles may be moving according to known dynamics. With the use of the *do_mpc* library, both linear and nonlinear MPC is possible.

ToDo:
- Robust MPC
- Simulator separately?
- 3D
- Test 2D with more complex dynamics (e.g. differential drive bot incl. non-holonomic constraints)
